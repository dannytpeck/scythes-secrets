# Scythe's Secrets
A dungeon crawling game made with Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9

I'm learning Pygame as I go along, so expect frequent updates!

# Introduction
In the not-so distant past, in the land of Symphonetta, there was a powerful Sorceress named Scythe. 

Scythe was clever and strong and knew many powerful magics. She was known in many countries and famously had tamed the Dread Dragon Integra. And she was wise, too, for she knew that her power was coveted by the leaders and monarchs of the countries surrounding her own tiny homeland. It was only a matter of time before they would attack her homeland and ransack the peaceful towns there, hoping to weaken her power or steal some of it for themselves. 

So, in order to protect her people and herself, she traveled all around the outer ring of her homeland. Every year, she would travel to the next town along the border. In each town, she stayed a year; and in each town, when she left, there stood a well-fortified library that had not stood there before. At the end of ten years, suddenly and without warning, Scythe disappeared.

News of the mysterious vanishing of the Sorceress traveled fast, and rumors faster: many had seen her flitting from place to place, and it was common knowledge that she had built a library in every town she visited. Few knew what secrets those libraries held, but people began to suspect that Sorceress Scythe might be hiding in them-- or that she might at least have left some of her artifacts of sorcery behind in them. 

Five years have passed since Sorceress Scythe first disappeared, and many have tried-- and failed-- to find secret signs of her within the libraries she built. The leaders and monarchs of neighboring countries, disappointed, have at least turned their attention away from Symphonetta for now, though they remain a definite threat. The people of the land, though they miss their sorceress, are just grateful that she left them such wonderful and artfully crafted buildings before she vanished from the world.

And then, one day...a secret panel opened in the back of a book in the back of the basement in the Balladier Library.
